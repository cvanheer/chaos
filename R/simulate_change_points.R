#' Description: Create a sequence of trials for each one with change points
#' @param n.trials the total number of trials in the experiment
#' @param min.trials minimum number of trials before a change point
#' @param max.trials maximum number of trials before a change point occurs
#' @param exp.rate average number of trials before a change point - controls the hazard function (1/lambda) this exp.rate is the lambda
#' @importFrom stats rexp
#' @return trial_counter the number of trials before a change point
#' @export
